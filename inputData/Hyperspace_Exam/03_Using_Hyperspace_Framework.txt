~What does Workspace contain?@Location for activities to take place. Represented by tabs just under the User toolbar.
~What does the Workspace Header contain?@Displays information relevant to the open workspace.
~How should you define your reference to IEConnector?@Public Connector As IEConnector
~{TRUE/FALSE} The home workspace opens when the user logins.@TRUE.
~{TRUE/FALSE} The home workspace can be closed.@FALSE.
~{TRUE/FALSE} All activities in Hyperspace share a single connection to the database.@TRUE.
~Describe the Destroy event of the IEDControl interface.@The final method called before Hyperspace releases its reference to a control. Should be used to release all objects to avoid problems caused by circular references.
~What is the INI for activities?@E2N, think nactivity like old english.
~What is the INI for services?@E2S
~What is the INI for workspaces?@E2O
~{TRUE/FALSE} Sub Menu types can launch activities.@TRUE.  Think log out button.
~What are service records used for?@Service records enable components that provide data management or business logic services to Hyperspace activities. Services may be enabled for all of Hyperspace or limited to specific workspaces.
A good example of a service is the AccessManager which controls what items a user can view and/or use.
~When does an activity use a InfoProviderArray?@When another activity passes it in.
~What is IEConnector used for?@This is the interface for communication to the CachÃ© server. Used for transactions, RPCs, and Bulk RPCs.
~What is the INI for roles?@E2R
~What is does implementing IEDControl mean?@The object is a user control and will handle such things as printing, accepting a variety of parameters during startup, shutting down gracefully when requested, etc.
~What does Activity Tab List contain?@A list of available activities within the Workspace.
~What are role records used for?@Defining what Menu and Toolbar buttons are available.

~What do ARD and ERD objects represent?@Server and Client objects respectively.

~What is the INI for menus?@E2U, think ends in u
~What's the difference between putting a filter on a menu vs activity?@A filter on an activity applies all the time.
 A menu filter is specific to that point of access.

~{TRUE/FALSE} Menu/Toolbar types can launch activities?@FALSE.  They only group other menu records.

~What does the Activity Toolbar contain?@A set of quick-access buttons specific to an activity.

LACK OF APPLICATION LICENSING
INAPPROPRIATE WORKSTATION
INAPPROPRIATE TIME OF DAY

~What is defined in menu records?@Navigation menus and toolbars, which can represent menus, submenus, menu items, toolbars, toolbar options, etc.
~What is IEDWorkspace used for?@This reference represents the workspace you are operating w/i. Allows you to see workspace-related info as well as configure menus, headers, and other workspace-related properties.
~{TRUE/FALSE} A Service can reference either a user control or a class module.@TRUE.
~When does an activity use Published Information?@There's data published to the workspace and nothing passed in the InfoProvider.
~How many user roles should a user have?@1.
~How can an activity get a requested record?@InfoProviderArray > Published Information > Hyperspace Service
~What is defined in activity records?@1. The ActiveX Control Hyperspace initiates 
2.Needed parameters 
3.Filter info about menu and toolbar options
~What is IEDActivity used for?@This reference represents your current activity and contains activity-specific info such as the info requested during startup.
~{TRUE/FALSE} Each user must have a User Role defined before he or she can log in to Hyperspace.@TRUE.
~Describe the ActiveChanged event of the IEDControl interface.@Called directly after run during startup, but will also fire every time your activity gains or loses focus.
~Define Security Classification.@A Security Classification is a setting applied to each user (usually on an application-by-application basis) that determines what options the user has access to within the system.
*/
~What does the In Basket Alert Bar contain?@Information on the current user, In Basket, tickler list, and time.

Limit the number of concurrent workspaces
Change the action taken after a period of idle time
~Define Info Name.@A string key that identifies a specific type of data that you need to look up.  These are listed on Activity and Service Records.
~Describe the Run event of the IEDControl interface.@Called directly after initialize. Passes in additional parameters, and allows you to abort or fail startup and provide a fail reason to the user.
~Describe the CanQuit event of the IEDControl interface.@Called when Hyperspace wants to close the activity. Under certain conditions, it allows cancelling of the shutdown process.
~What is defined in a Service Record?@A list of Info Names that it can handle.
A ProgId for the osx or dll.
~What could be configured at the workspace level?@1.Workspace tab
2.Workspace Header
3.Activity tabs list
4.Published objects
~What is defined in workspace records?@The menu and toolbar records that are available.
